First challenge from [Wes Bos Vanilla Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/).

## 🔧 Tecnologies

Built with HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JavaScript.

## 📐 JavaScript methods and functions

- querySelectorAll()
- play()
- classList.add()
- classList.remove()
- propertyName
- forEach
- addEventListener()

## 📚 What did I learn

- That there's an `<audio>` HTML tag
- That each key from keyboard has a related number (_keyCode_). If you wan't to know each number you can visit [this site](https://www.toptal.com/developers/keycode)
- New kind of EventListeners: _keydown, transitionend_
- That JavaScript has a function to `play()`

## 😉 Fun Facts

1. My husband is actually a drummer, so I used a picture from him playing at _**The Drive Sessions**_, a music video project we had together a long time ago (at our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TheDrivesessions) you have tons of videos from all kind of music, live recorded at a sound studio).
2. I shouldn't talk about this but in my _let's do it right_ attitude I tried to make this project responsive, when you can't actually play it from your mobile as you need to press a keyboard...😅

Anyway, thanks for reading, and don't forget [to play](https://ceciperiquet.github.io/javascript-drum-kit/) 🥁
